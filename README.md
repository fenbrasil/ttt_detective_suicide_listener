# Trouble in Terrorist Town - Detective suicide listener

This is a simple script to watch for Detective suicides.

This is based on a need on the server since we have a rule for Detective killing and suiciding, which is considered grifing and usually result in punishment. What this will do it to log everytime a Detective player suicides, so staff can analyse and punish that player.

This script's main function will only work if you have ULX and ULib on your server.

The script runs 100% server-side, and has no need for any networking stuff or other complicated stuff. So it is pretty straightforward.
